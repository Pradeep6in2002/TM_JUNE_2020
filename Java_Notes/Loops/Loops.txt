Looping statements:

looping statements are used to iterate same statement for a specific number of times.

looping statements are also used for the purpose of parameterization.

parametrization is the process of replacing the variable value in run time.



java supports the following looping statements:

1.for loop

this loop is called as definite loop

this loop will have a starting point and aswell as a ending point

syntax:

for( int somevariable=startingpointvalue;condition( how many time doe your loop to get execute); increment value for the variable)
{


//logic

}


for (int i=1;i<=20;i++){
//logic here
}


parametrization:

print a 2 table using for loop:


2 * 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 3 = 6 



static==== 2*, = 

// use for loop and print the number between 1-50

without using any looping statments can you print numbers from 1-50

// complete it as a task

hint: create a method and pass the value which indicates that how manytime does method should execute

you can use max of one  if condition



for each loop:

for each loop is used to iterate the collection objects or iteratable objects

syntax:

for( datatype somevariable:collectionObject){

//print logic

}

while loop:

while loop is called as a indefinite loop
while loop will check condition as an entry criteria
only if the condition is true the body will get executed
user must define the failing statement to exist out of theloop, if there is no failing statement, the body will never get terminated.such case will make the loop to execute as indefinite loop

indefinite loops will leads into system crash error resulting memory out of flow


syntax:

while(somecondition){
//statements
}

print numbers from 1-50


Do-While Loop:

do while loop will not check for any condition on entry
atleast once , the code will get executed without checking any condition.

once all the statements is completed for the firsttime, it will start checking teh condition.


syntax:

do
{



}while(condition);



explain about break and continue?


to exit out of the loop we use break keyword
after break keyword we are not suppose to write any statement.


continue:

to skip any iteration and move on to the next iteration, then use continue keyword.

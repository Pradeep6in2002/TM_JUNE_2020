how to return a value from a definition?
when we write a logic inside a method, the user might expect the outputfrom it, to give back the value from the definition we use return keyword inside the method.

when the emethod is returning a value , we can assign them to a variable.

in otherword, the value to the variable can a definition also

if the method is not returning any value , then the output will be given as "None"


conditional statements:

conditional statements are used to alter the flow of execution based on some condition

in python we have conditional statements like

	* if
	* if else
	* el if


if : this is called as simple if statement

this statement will check only for true statement
if the conditionn is true then only the body will get executed

syntax:

if somecondition:

	//logic


looping statements:

looping statements are used to iterate same set of statements for a specific number of time

in python we have looping statements like

	for 
	while

this for loop can be used in different ways
	* with range fucntion 
	* with iteratble object


while loop:

while loop is also used to itearte a value

while loop is a condition based loop

while will check for a true statement, if it is true then only the body gets executed

user must need to write a failing condition to exit out from the loop.

if there is no failing statement avaialble, the loop wil run as indefinite loop

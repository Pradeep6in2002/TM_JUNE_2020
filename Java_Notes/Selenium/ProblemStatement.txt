Problem:

Raj want to open any type of browser, because his test case demands every a time a new browser type
in one test case he may use chrome
in another test case he may use ff

in onne test case half of the scenario in chrome and half of the scenario in ff, he may get any type requirement based upon the testcase.

now can u suggest the best way to write the code in selenium, it should not be a duplicate code and more over he should be able to open any kind of application on the fly

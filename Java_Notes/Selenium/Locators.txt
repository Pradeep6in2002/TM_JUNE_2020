How to identify the webelements on the webpage?

WebElements are the elements developed by using HTML

CSS are used for the purpose of styling on the webpage

these properties are called as attributes also.

using these attributes, in selenium there are 8 types of locators available

* id
* name

* css --- ****
* tag name
* classname

* partial linktext


in HTML there are two types of tags available

* paired html tags
* unpaired html tags

paired html tag: tags which have open and close tags we call it as paired html tags

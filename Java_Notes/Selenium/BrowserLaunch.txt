Selenium is a web automation tool which works on anytype of browsers like chrome,ff,ie,edge

selenium doesnt have direct interaction with the live browsers

live browsers-- browsers which are installed on the machine


Note:
if i want to make selenium to interact with any browser, i should install them prior to my execution.

selenium takes the help of browser drivers all the time to invoke them.

but here there is a chalenge that will arise all the time for a qa and it is called as maintaince proces.

what is the problem?

we dont know when the browser will get upfdated, when ever a browser updated we must have updated driver in hand.

QA needs to checks every time if there is a updated browser available or not which is maintaince task.


suppose if we are runnung the testcases in nightmode , due browser compatability the testcases got failed. so we lost a valuable run over the night


to avoid such issue, DriverManager is introduced.

Drivermanger it itself will check latest driver for the browser and it will invoke the right browser

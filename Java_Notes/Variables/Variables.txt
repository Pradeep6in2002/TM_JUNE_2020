How to start writting the code in java?

Before that understand few terms in java s/w


* JDK
* JRE
* Compiller


JDK/JRE:

JDK---java development kit

this jdk helps the user to develop the code as well as to execute the code


JRE is called as Java Run Time Environment, it helps only to execute the program but not developement


Compiler:

java is a server side programming language, which is used to develop complex application

To execute these programs, we need a person, so called compiler

in java the compiler is JVM----Java Virtual Machine

This JVM will come along with s/w installation

we can view this JVM

JVM is a self programmed s/w

it have set of rules and regulation that need to be follow while developing the code.

when ever  we write any code , JVM will get invoked and it will scan the code then and there and will understand the syntax is correct or not , are you follwing the rules of java or not.

java is purely a rule based programming language


How to start writting the code in java?

Java always force the user to write the  code in aplaceholder called "ClassFile"

How to create a classfile?

Go to project folder
Go to SRC
create a package
create a classfile


while creating a class file ensure that , we always give the name of the classfile in capital letter as starting , and proceed with the camel case

AnnnnB

What is the structure of a class?

syntax:

class SomeName{

//write the  logics


}

for a java class there 5 major components available

* variables
* methods
* constructors
* static block
* instance block

variables:

variables are called as memory holders.

when ever we want to store any data in java , we use variables 

but this variables have some set of rules.


1.open phone
2.click on dial pad
3.enter number
4.click on save
5.enter the name

**********************************

1.open phone
2.click on dial pad
3.type the name
4.get the names with the matching information---- number with names


in java if we want to store any data , i need to specify the datatype
then the appropriate size will allocated such that user can store data inside a variable

if we want to see teh value of a varaible we want to call by the name of the varaible, such that the value will be printed


how to create a variables?

syntax:

datatype someVariableName;// declaration

in java every statement should end with a semicolon


when you declare a variable a empty block will be created


inserting data into a memory block is called as intialization

it is process of assigning value into a memory block
 by using an operator called "=", we call "=" as assignment operator

how to assign a value to variable?

varaiable name=somevalue;


////////////////////////////////////////

datatype somevariableName;//dec
somevariableName=somevalue//intiali


to see the output in java we use  a statemnt called as System.Out.Println(somevariableName)


Note:

To execute your code in java, we must have a main method

syntax:

public static void main(String[] args){

//write the logic

}


Datatypes:

Datatype specifies what type of data is being stored inside a variable

there are different types of data available

* number
* text
* true/false
* decimals
* date and time etc


for each type there is a dedicated datatypes

this datatypes are divided into two types

	* primitive datatypes
	* non-primitive datatypes


number---- int
text------ String
true/false--- boolean
decimal--- float
large number--- long
bigger decimal---- double
single char--- char
byte 
short

How to write the method as reusable method?

When ever we write any logic , we should think  does this method gives the output with different inputs.

it mean that , the inputvalue or the input data should not be hardcoded.

the inputvalue or the data must be always dynamic in nature.

when we build a method amd the logic requires input data , never try to hard code it

for example:


i want to add two numbers

logic: 

int a, b, c;

a=20;
b=30;
c=a+b;


here if we observe the data is 20 and 30 as input values
logic sum of aand b

here my logic will always remain same, but the input data memebers will alsways get changed.



How to send the input values to the methods?

Sending input values to the method are called as argumnents

Accepting the input values by the method is called as "Parameters"

syntax:


accessspecifiers static/instance returnType  methodname(datatype param,datatype param....){

//logic 

}

Note:
Total number of params must be equal to total number of araguments with same type


Methodname+Params is called as "Signature"


Can i assign a method to variable?

Returntype:

When we want to return some data from the method as an output to the use we use the keyword called return.

Note:

in the method definition we must need to specify the datatype of teh return data

for ex: the sum of two numbers is int

so i want to return the output of two numbers which is a int.

so my return type also must be int



syntax with return type:


accessspecifier static/instance  returntype / void methodName(param...){


return someoutput
}


Note:

after a return statement user is not allowed to write any kind of logic or statements.
Return indicated , is the closure of a method
if we try to write any logic we get an exception called "Unreachable code"

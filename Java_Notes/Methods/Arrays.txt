Arrays:

Arrays are introduced to overcome the problem in the variables

Problem in variables is , user can store max of one value under a variable name

to store multiple values,under a single variable arrays are introduced.

Arrays are called as Homgenius by default in nature.

How arrays will work?

array will store multiple values in the memeory block assign spave for each value.

each value will have an index mapped.

index will always starts from 0


suppose i want to store all the employee names

my variable name will be employee_names


while creating my array to store employee details , i need to tell the compiler saying that the count of employees.

i need to store 5 employees.

it means that array is depend on size
once u define the size, the block will be created in the main memeory

here user should remain the following things:

1.syntax:

Datatype[] somevaraiblename=new Datatype[size]// array declaration

when we declared an array with size , memery blocks will be created in the main memeory

2.add elements to the array

in the array to add the elements we must specify the index.

syntax:
arrayvariable[index]=value

Note:
1.you can able to add only the datatype that is matcing while you declared in craeting an array.
2.Keep an eye on the index that you are specifying.

say my array size 8, index=7, now if try to insert the value at index 8......no wil get an exception saying that index outof bound 

3.Arrays values can be retrived by specifying the index only
4.once you declared the size , u cant change the size in run time. as arrays are fixed in size
5.to retive the values from an array , we can retrive based on index only.
6.arrays are iteratable , there is a special loop statememt available called as "for each"
7.arrays can be iterate over any looping statements like for,while,do while loop, for each loop


for each loop:

syntax:

for(Datatype variable:iteratble object){

//use variable name

}


this for each will pick up each element available in the array.
it will iterate each item that is available on the given array

***************************************************************************************

To convert the array to hetrogenius, we can use the class called "object"

in java for all classes the parent class is called as Object class.

this class will provide Object array

remember that arrays fall under non primitive

user created class will also comes under non primitive category only.
eve the class you created, will also have an array------**** Try and let me know if this line worked ******

synatx:

Object[] someVariableName=new Object[size]

Task: 
1.Create an array with the duplicate elements and find how many duplicates are available
2.Craete two arrays and check if the array 1 is subset of arary2
3.Create an integer array with 6 elements and check what is highest value and lowest value

Problem statement:

Raj need to add the student details to the database, unfortunately raj doesnt have a DB to store the data.

His logic should be in mode of generating teh student id in a sequential way.

He is allowed to send the student details like

	* Name
	* Place
	* standard

Your logic should help him to generate the ID, remember you are not suppose tos end the id, logic should generate the ID  and it must be sequential.


new Student();


if the members are static, the memory will be given by the class which is called as main memeory

the old data will still persit


for the instance members, object will allocate memeory, when ever we c reate an object a new memory allocation will be happen, old value will not persist

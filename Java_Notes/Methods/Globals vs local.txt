What are types of variables?

* Global (static/instance)
* local

variables which are defined at the class level but not inside the method

define?----declare

global level variables will be in live through out the execution and hence forth we can use at any place


local variables:

variables which are defined at the method level is called as local variables
the life time or scope of the variable will be within the method itself
we can not access them out side the method

Note:

when the global and the local variables having the same name, the compiler will take priority on local variables only

method params are also called as local variables


To take the values of global variables by the compiler when we have both global variables and local variables with the same name so to differentiate b/n global and local we use the keyword called "this"

this represents current class variables and methods.

inside the static methods we can not use this keyword

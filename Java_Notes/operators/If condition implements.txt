how do you know if the login is sucessfull or not

so in the method i need to define a boolean value and that method should return a boolean value

based on this output , will take a decision and we will print status as pass or fail


public static boolean login(String userName, String passWord){

// enter credentials
// check if username and pasword matched

// if matches return true else return false

}

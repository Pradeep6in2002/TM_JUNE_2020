if else:

when your simple if condition is false , and if we want to print or execute some other logic we use else block

syntax:

if (some condition){
//write your logic
}else{
// write some other logic to get execute when the simple if is false
}

else if:

when your simple if is failed or false and if you want to check any other alternative condition , inn such scenarios we use if else

ex:

as an user i pass a number , based on a number input  you must print the day 


conditions:

1.check if the number is ranged in b/n 1-7
2.if step 1 is true then check the user given input value accordingly print the output
3.if step1 is false, print "invalid input"


Switch case:

this switch case is an alternative of else if conditions.

in switch case, only if the match is found , the matched logic will get executed.

if no match is found no logic is executed.


switch case will do comparision based on the key value.


syntax:

switch(key)
{

case "matching input value either string or int" :

	//logic;
	break;
case "matching input value either string or int" :

	//logic;
	break;
case "matching input value either string or int" :

	//logic;
	break;

default:
//this block will get executed when there is no match found on the above listed cases


}

note:

break is keyword which is mandatory

if we skip the break keyword, the next case will get executed automatically

I have a string which contain my pannumber ,bank account number, date of birth and email etc.


now i need to validate the format of my pannumber,bank account number and dateof birth.

the string looks like

"Pan Number : KLIPO9600E  Bank A/C :SDFG7895-9087-BC DOB: 09/08/1990"

now i need to validate the format:

ex in pan card -- 5 alphabets in caps and 4 mumeric and 1 alpha in caps

so i can do this using my string methods, but its too much cost in design and execution.

to over come that problem we use regular expression


In Regex whole string will not get parsed by char by char.
user must define a pattern, if the pattern is available then only the data retrival will happen.

no matter how much dynamic the content is available, once you define the pattern, it have capacity to identify the content in the string.


how to write a pattern in regex?

1.character set
[]
[A-Z][0-9][a-z]===and representation

[A-Za-z0-9]=== or represnation when we have combination is a word
Ert
Abbbb
nnnAAA

when the given data is dynamic in nature , we should not hard code the data, rather we must use characterset which may available in the given range


ex: my pan number is DGHJK8520E


To represent groups in regex==={size}

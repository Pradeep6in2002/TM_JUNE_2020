static block:

in java there is a dedicated block called as static block
this block will be executed as soon as a class is loaded.
all the static memebers in the class will get memory by the class.

syntax:

static{
//logic here
}

this block will get executed when ever the class is loaded.

How to load a class?

class.forName("packagename.classname")


when you write this syntax, you may get an exception that , the class you are trying into load may not be available.


the static block will called only once, if we retry to load the class, the block will get called only once.

what can i write inside my static block?

connecting to database
loading the json testdata
creating test results. etc..



Insstance block:

representation is {}

this bloack will be executed when an object is created


Note: static block execute onlyonce

instance will execute, as many time you create an object


when there is a constructor and instance block available, 1st instrance block will get executed and then only constructor will get executed.

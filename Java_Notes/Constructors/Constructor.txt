Constructor is called as blockof code which triggers as soon as when an object is created.

by deafult there will be a zero argument based constructor available for the class in the background

the constructor will looks same as method, but the name of the constructor must be always as a classname.

constructor can not return a value

why constructor is needed?

By default constructor will instialize all the class level variables.

if the class level variables are declared but no intialized such scenrio, constructor will assign the default values based on the datatype provided.
if we want tp run any logic during the object creation paralley then we use constructor in the place.

it act like a place holder , where user can pass the data to the class.


Can the user create his own zero argument constructor?
Yes, when we try to create our own zero argument constructor then the default constructor available in the background will be removed.

syntax:

className(){


}


this constru tor will behave differently when we have oops in place.

how many constructor can have in a class?

we have have as many as you have, but the arguments should not match
this is called as constructor overloading

samename , but with different arguments



Can i use this keyword inside a constructor to represent the class level variables?

Yes you can, even the members are static in nature.

can i call a constructor from another constructor?

yes, you can call by using a method called this()

using this() we need send appropriate arguments

note: while calling a constructor from athor constructor, calling statement must be always the first statement

from a constructor we can call only one constructor one at a time
